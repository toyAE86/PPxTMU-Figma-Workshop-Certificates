# PPxTMU-Figma-Workshop-Certificates
On November 18th, 2024, Pixel Perfect and TMU UX hosted a collab Figma workshop virtually. Sheridan College's very own Jamie March, a professor in the Experiential Design and Product Design Certificate programs, led the event. Those who attended are eligible for a certificate issued by the hosting clubs. Thank you to everyone who came, hope to see you during our part 2 session in early 2025. Stay tuned!
